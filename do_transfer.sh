# NOTE: Some differences between this and the previous transfer:
# * We enable notifications.  This lets the user know sooner that their data
#   are ready!
# * We skip the activation checks.  The user is not present at this time;
#   if an endpoint is not activated, we will rely on Globus to notify them.
# * We do not do endpoint checks.  We want to allow for the possibility that
#   the data are being transferred to something like a laptop, which might not
#   be online at the precice time the transfer is started.
